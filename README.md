#  ALX Project 0x04 - StateCraft: Mastering State Management with Redux & Context API

## Project Summary
This project demonstrates how to manage shared state across components in a React + Next.js app using three different methods:

- useState (local state)

- Context API (global state for small apps)

- Redux (global state for large-scale apps)

The app used to demonstrate all three is a fun Counter App, which updates and displays a counter value with visual feedback.

## Objectives
- By the end of this project, you will:

- Understand and apply useState for local component state

- Use Context API to share state across multiple components

- Set up and use Redux Toolkit for scalable global state management

- Compare the pros and cons of each approach

- Learn how to persist and structure state logically in a Next.js project

- Gain experience in writing typed state logic using TypeScript
